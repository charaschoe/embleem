# Security Fixes Summary for Embleem

## Overview
This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities identified and fixed in the Embleem application.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. API Key Exposure (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Issue**: The Unsplash API key was exposed in client-side code through `import.meta.env.VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`
**Impact**: API key visible to all users, potential abuse and rate limit exhaustion
**Fix**: 
- Created secure server-side API proxy routes at `/api/unsplash/` and `/api/unsplash/random/`
- Changed environment variable from `VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` to `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`
- Updated all client components to use secure proxy endpoints
- Added comprehensive input validation in proxy routes

### 2. Path Traversal Vulnerability (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Issue**: User input used directly in file path construction without sanitization
**Impact**: Potential access to files outside intended directory
**Fix**: 
- Added input sanitization in `getLocalImagePath()` functions
- Removed dangerous characters and limited filename length
- Implemented proper path construction with validation

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Issue**: Missing Content Security Policy and security headers
**Impact**: Potential XSS attacks and clickjacking
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP) header
- Implemented additional security headers:
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### 4. Input Validation Issues (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Issue**: Inconsistent input validation across the application
**Impact**: Potential injection attacks and data corruption
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive input validation for all API proxy parameters
- Implemented parameter sanitization and type checking
- Added proper error handling and validation messages

## Dependency Vulnerabilities

### Fixed:
- **brace-expansion**: Updated to fix RegEx DoS vulnerability (2 vulnerabilities reduced to 0)

### Remaining:
- **cookie** package: 2 low severity vulnerabilities
- Requires breaking changes to SvelteKit to fix (not recommended for production app)

## Files Modified

### New Security Files:
- `src/routes/api/unsplash/+server.ts` - Secure API proxy for search
- `src/routes/api/unsplash/random/+server.ts` - Secure API proxy for random photos
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template with security notes
- `security-test.sh` - Automated security testing script

### Updated Files:
- `src/lib/unsplash.ts` - Updated to use secure proxy, added path sanitization
- `src/lib/animalList.js` - Updated to use secure proxy, added path sanitization
- `src/components/WordleMode.svelte` - Updated API calls, fixed path traversal
- `src/app.html` - Added CSP and security headers
- `README.md` - Added security documentation and best practices

## Security Testing

A comprehensive security test suite has been created (`security-test.sh`) that verifies:
- ✅ API keys are not exposed in build output
- ✅ Environment template contains placeholder values
- ✅ Security headers are properly configured
- ✅ Secure API proxy routes exist
- ✅ Input validation is implemented
- ✅ Path traversal protection is in place

## Configuration Changes

### Before (Insecure):
```env
VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=actual_key_here  # Exposed to client!
```

### After (Secure):
```env
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=actual_key_here  # Server-side only
```

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Setup**: Use the new `.env.example` as template
2. **API Key Security**: Ensure `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` is set server-side only
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor API usage for any suspicious patterns
4. **Updates**: Regularly update dependencies, especially SvelteKit when cookie vulnerability is fixed
5. **Testing**: Run `./security-test.sh` before each deployment

## Impact Assessment

- **Risk Reduction**: Critical API key exposure eliminated
- **Compatibility**: All changes are backward compatible with existing functionality
- **Performance**: Minimal impact, API calls now go through local proxy
- **Maintenance**: Cleaner separation of concerns between client and server

## Verification

All security fixes have been verified through:
- Automated security testing suite
- Code review of all modified files
- Validation of environment variable usage
- Testing of API proxy functionality
